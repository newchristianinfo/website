# Jesus is God

From before creation, for all of eternity. Jesus is God.
<br><br>
This is questioned by some because Jesus directly saying "I am God" is not directly in the Bible, but some simple points worth noting.
<br><br>
For Jesus to call himself "God" would not have cleared much up in the timeframe he was living. There were innumerable "God's" worshiped everywhere in every country. It would be like in today's terms Jesus declaring himself a super hero.
<br><br>
A short study of "the messiah" which all of the old testament points toward and longs for will illuminate that Jesus clearly presented himself as the messiah. Most often seen in Jesus claiming the "Son of Man" title which was a nickname for the messiah given in Malicahi (which book ?)
<br><br>
If only we could go back and examine the evidence. But wait, <RoughNotation isShow type="underline">what was Jesus convicted of?</RoughNotation>
<br><br>
We sometimes simplify the circumstances of Jesus's crucifixion as a mob killing. But Israel at the time was under the legal authority of Rome which has legal traditions that would be familiar to Americans (the US court system was mostly based on the Roman system). There's a case with witnesses and facts to consider. Someone can't just be punished without a law broken.
<br><br>
The Jewish leaders brought Jesus to trial with the accusation of "Blasphemy". There was a strong motivation to throw the book at Jesus, but this was the only broken law his accusers could present. Blasphemy means "Claiming you are God". Jesus was convicted of "Claiming he was God" in a court of law and sentenced to death. So let's not 2000 years later think we can judge better if Jesus said he was God.
<br><br>
A death sentence at that time required a second approval from a Roman authority named Ponticus Pilot. This was a difficult request for Pilot to review because Blasphemy was not a Roman law. Jesus had broke no Roman laws but was sentenced to death by Roman execution. Pilot calls to speak with Jesus where Jesus says "You Pilot are a King. So am I. I'm the King of Kings" and "Don't worry about sending me to die, it's my choice. I have an army at my command that I'm also asking to allow me to die" which leaves Pilot with no choice but to let the execution continue.
