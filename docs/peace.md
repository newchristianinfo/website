<Verse>
Paul's quote that we are either a slave to freedom, or slave to sin. 
</Verse>
<Verse>
Jesus "Rest is found by taking my yoke"
</Verse>

Every person from a young age is aware of a scary set of realties:
- There are expectations made on people
- There is a judge (God, if they believe in a god, or otherwise social media/opinion)
- A negative judgment will bring pain or death
- I am guilty of not meeting the expectations
- Judgment is coming
- I don't want pain or death
<br><br>


This leads to an endless, exhausting life of:
- Being offended by the expectations and insisting they don't apply
- Surrounding myself with people that sooth my guilt. (verse about, come let's kill someone in cold blood together) (maybe Psalms 1?)
- Identity management, controlling how other people see us
- Resume building. Look at all the good I've done! (verse from Paul that all my good works are received as bloody tampons)
- Despair. Maybe we don't feel capable enough to pursue any of the above. We treasure our pain and seek others in pain to share in the experience.
- Methodical destruction of all differences. If there were no differences between people, if we trained people to never make choices or have opinions then nobody will be able to see what's wrong with me ("Screwtape proposes a Toast by C.S. Lewis)
<br><br>
## Slave to Sin
All people are born with an instinct to sin. Without the work of Jesus, there is no other choice. They think they making personal choices by breaking away from God, but if they literally have no ability to choose differently, that's not freedom. It's slavery. That's why it's foolish to judge people's motives and actions who have not had the saving work of Jesus by any standard of life that is only possible through the miracle of Jesus coming into our heart (born again)

## Slave to Jesus
Only the gospel of Jesus resolves our scary reality and frees us from the exhausting life detailed above.
<br><br>
But while Jesus' gift is free, we can't live in light and darkness at the same time. We can't live like we are adopted and in fear of judgment at the same time. It's a letting go that produces rest and peace, but leaves us wholly dependent on Jesus for our escape from judgement. Maybe that's why "Slave to Jesus" is the word picture chose by Paul.
<br><br>

A surprisingly different life:
- Not offended, but rather delight in law <Todo>(proverbs/psalms reference)</Todo>
- Don't use friends to sooth guilt. But be salt and light and point to the one that can heal anyone's guilt.
- Let go of how others see us. Other people don't need to see us, we are not the hero of the story. Let them see Jesus in our life. (verse about fear man vs fear of god)
- Leave the resume unmaintained. You already got the position.
- Don't despair (verses on our identity in christ)
- Celebrate differences. Celebrate greatness when it happens in others. Celebrate the infinite greatness of God.
