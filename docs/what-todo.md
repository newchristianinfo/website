# What we get to do with God
<Nav></Nav>

The point of this topic is to demonstrate how finite (short/limited) the things are that God has asked of his children.
<br><br>
Most of the Kingdom of God and life with Jesus is about letting go.  Let go of the FOMO that life would be better if we were God.
<br><br>
- To be born again / Be baptized
- Communion / Be part of a church (there's a verse for that, right?)
- Bible reading / Prayer
- Go tell others / Make Disciples
- Rest / Don't need to make ourselves great
- Follow God with all your heart, soul, and mind
- Love your neighbor as yourself
