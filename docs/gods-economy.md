# God's Economy
<Nav></Nav>

It's instinctive to make all our choices based on a cost/benefit analysts. To exchange effort or treasure for an expected greater treasure or utility for ourself.
<br><br>
The result of "The Great Exchange" (Martin Luther) leaves us already having more than we could have ever have known to ask for. This is seen in the Parable of the Prodigal Son. There's an discussion between the older brother and the father where the brother says "you never gave me anything" and the father says "Don't you see, everything I have is already yours"
<br><br>
This not-instinctive view of wealth, growth, and progress makes sense when we consider, are out efforts aimed at building my own kingdom, or God's kingdom?
<br><br>
In today's democratic countries, it's worth a refresher. Most of human history has existed in Kingdoms. In a kingdom, there is no personal property. No personal power or wealth. EVERYTHING belongs to the king. People have things because the king has delegated the care and management of something to a person. All profit and production belongs to the king.
<br><br>
(insert passage from Jesus about "whatever you do for your own reward, that is all the reward you will get. So do in secret without expectation of reward to my Father will see what you've done and reward you")
<br><br>
This frees us from making all choices based on a cost/benefit analysis for our immediate personal gain. Allows us to listen to God's leading in our every day and find value in actions that bring a little heaven to earth ("God's will be done, on earth as it is in heaven").
<br><br>
This shows up as generosity that could be seen by outsiders as ridiculous (laughable, worthy of insult.. bible reference?). As a giving of time, talent, or money in a way that could not have any expectation of being repaid. (verse about being a 'living sacrifice')
<br><br>
But it's not that we are not repaid.. it's that we are repaid in a different way.. maybe not even in this life. ('store up treasures in heaven' verse)
<br><br>
“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and
then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.” (reference?)
<br><br>
“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of
great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.” Matthew 13:44-46
