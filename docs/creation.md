# Creation
<Nav></Nav>

You don't have to believe in Creation to be saved and go to heaven.  God loves you and chose you.
<br><br>
But evolution is wrong and goes against this advice:<br>
-- Don't make a habit of believing things that are wrong and don't stand the test of time.
<br><br>
That habit will lead to being further and further out of step with reality which in turn means painful collisions with reality will happen more often.
<br><br>
<u>Creation is Biblical</u><br>
- Adam/Eve existed before death entered the world.
- God created all the animals and said "it was good", people and said "it was very good".. think of all the death required for millions of years, is "it was very good" an appropriate response?
- God created time itself, with comments like "before time began, I AM".  The name God gave for himself is "I Am", uniquely separating himself from all creation. 

<br>
<u>Creation is Awesome</u><br>
God created all the stars in one day! That's awesome!
God "spoke" and everything we live in and are beginning to understand came to be. Wow!
What's the problem with being impressed by God? What's the motivation to tell others they can't be impressed?
<br><br>
Sure, creating our universe sounds big and all, but don't we trust God for even bigger things? The Bible says that God knows every day of our life before we are born. And even though we die, we will live. We will live forever. Forever on a new Earth. A new Earth created by God. That's awesome! It's ok to celebrate greatness. We trust God with our own eternal life.. it's ok to say "Created in 6 days? Yippie, yahoo, way to go God!"

<br><br>
<u>Evolution does not add up</u><br>
The more we learn how brilliantly our universe is made, the more zeros evolutionists add to the number of years it took, but the astronomical number of years creates new problems. Here are two:
- Our sun is a fire. It consumes fuel as it burns. How long can it burn? How many years old is our solar system? How big would the sun have been at the start to burn down to today's size?  That big of a sun creates more mathematical problems.
- The moon's distance from the earth increases 1.48 inches each year. A simple evidence of this is that total solar eclipses are not as "total" as they were a century ago. The moon used to be closer to the earth, and the older the earth is, the closer the moon once was. There's a limit to how many zeros you can add to the age of the earth.

<br><br>
<u>Evolution is not scientific</u>
- Officially among scientists, it has always been a theory, not a law.
- The book "On The Origin of Species" popularized the theory. Then it was later refuted by Charles Darwin.  Darwin wrote a followup book called "On The Origin of Species" that follows chapter-by-chapter rebuking his own work.
- Scientists today have generally agreed evolution has [a lot of unsolved problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noj4phMT9OE).
- Even if Darwin's origin of species was logically possible, it does not begin to explain the origin of the universe. In fact some of science's most trusted laws are known as Newton's laws of Thermal Dynamics. #1) Energy cannot be created or destroyed. #2) Spontaneous processes increase disorder.

<br><br>
<u>Evolution is not Biblical</u><br>
- Evolutionist say "But what does 'day' really mean?" (side note, you're in a dangerous spot when you sound like the snake in the garden asking Eve "But did god really say...?")
- Only one verse hints at questioning the word "day", it says "to God, a day is like 1000 years".  Simply put, that verse means God created everything, including time itself.  God exists outside of time.  To think of it like a mathematician-- If time is the 4th dimension, what would a 5th dimensional being be like?
- The creation record is clear, a full day is defined as "evening and morning" (Genesis 1:23)
- The creation record is clear, night is defined as "when the stars are out" (Genesis 1:16)
- The creation record requires a day to not be a million years.  Plants were created on Day 3, the Sun and all stars were created on Day 4.  How long can plants last without the Sun?

<br><br>
<u>Evolution is not God Fearing</u><br>
This involves judging our own heart for motives. What makes a person read "God created all the animals. There was morning, and evening. The 6th day." and then be compelled to re-explain that that? Believing evolution makes it easier to be accepted by non-christians. It is rewarding.
<br><br>
Some well meaning Christians want to make God more acceptable to non-christians. Like a good PR or marketing department interrupting a controversial statement by a CEO.. "whoa whoa whoa, now what he really meant by that was.." But careful there. Who are we to be God's campaign manager?
<br><br>

<u>Evolution is a prerequisite to becoming our own God</u><br>
Without evolution, Satan's timeless promise of "you too can be like God" wouldn't go as well.
Evolution reframes which direction

<br><br>
<u>Evolution requires more "belief" than Creation</u><br>
“Sometimes when I'm faced with an atheist, I am tempted to invite him to the greatest gourmet dinner that one could ever serve, and when we have finished eating that magnificent dinner, to ask him if he believes there's a cook.” - Ronald Reagan

<br><br>
Back to the point at the top of this article, believing in evolution trains your mind to stop asking questions, to grow callused to logic, and hide from reality.
