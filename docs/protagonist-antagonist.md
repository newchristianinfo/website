# Protagonist vs the Antagonist
<Nav></Nav>

One of God's creation decided he wanted to be his own God.  We call him Satan.
<br><br>
Some make the mistake of thinking too little of Satan (as in not at all).  But this polarized world does not make sense without acknowledging there is a second ruler.  A ruler of this world.
<br><br>
Some make the mistake of thinking too much of Satan.  Satan did not take your parking space just so you'd have a bad day.  He is not omni-present (everywhere at once) like God is, he can only be in one place at one time and there are more influential people than you taking his attention.
<br><br>
While Satan has lived much much longer than any of us, we could assume he has wisdom and power that is no match for us.  But he is not creative because he is not the creator.  His method of corruption does not change or grow into new forms.  With a little effort we can spot the wild opposites between Satan's way of living and God's way of living.
<br><br>
God creates, Satan counterfeits
God makes straight, Satan twists
God heals, Satan decays
God forgives, Satan accuses
God makes great things.  Like Newton's second law of thermal dynamics, Satan tears down great things into a mush if indifference.
God's word is true yesterday, today, tomorrow.  Satan's words are misleading or just plain untrue and don't stand the test of time.

From a business perspective, Satan is successful at staying true to his mission statement.  Read it here in Genesis 2:
<br><br>
"did got really say?" (misquote)
"you can be god"
"god is holding back from you"
<br><br>
A healthy response to Satan's 3 missional statements:
<br><br>
"did god really say?" -- we need to go to the source and spend at least as much time reading the bible directly as we do listening to teachers.
<br><br>
"you can be god"
<br><br>
"God is holding back from you"
This is what the Jesus Storybook Bible calls the "great lie."  That there's something better for us that Jesus will not give.  Spoiler alert-- God, not sparing his own son answered the question once and for all, there's nothing he wouldn't give us.
