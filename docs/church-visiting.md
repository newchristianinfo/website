Church is where we dive into the bible
The work of a teaching pastor is to faithfully present books of the Bible. It's quite a job to present God's timeless message in a way that's understood by the listener (that changes over the centuries, no?) but not over-contextualize it to the point that it's trying to appeal to a subculture of people.
<br><br>
Because a teaching pastor is speaking to a large audience, the goal should not be to present the one answer a specific question. God will use this sometimes and we will leave a sermon feeling like God was speaking just to me. But as a general habit, a pastor does well to present books of the bible as they were originally intended to be read - one book from beginning to end.
