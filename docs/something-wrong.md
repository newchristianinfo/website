# Something has gone wrong

Like any book or movie where a leader has a plan, and something goes wrong with that plan, it doesn't take much looking around to think "something has gone wrong"

In the first chapter of the Bible, God authors the world.

By chapter three, people decide to step away from God's authority, and author their own ideas about the world.

The actions of people have caused trouble for individuals, families, nations, and even the earth itself seems like it's breaking apart.

There's a longing, a cry for needing things to be fixed.  Good questions at this point would be "Who should fix things?" and "What's my role?"
