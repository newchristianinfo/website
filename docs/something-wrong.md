# Something has gone wrong
<Nav></Nav>

Like any book or movie where a leader has a plan, and something goes wrong with that plan, it doesn't take much looking around to think "something has gone wrong"
<br><br>
In the first chapter of the Bible, God authors the world.
<br><br>
By chapter three, people decide to step away from God's authority, and author their own ideas about the world.
<br><br>
The actions of people have caused trouble for individuals, families, nations, and even the earth itself seems like it's breaking apart.
<br><br>
There's a longing, a cry for needing things to be fixed.  Good questions at this point would be "Who should fix things?" and "What's my role?"
