(verse about equipping the saints)
It's easy to think the pastor's job is to do good things, help people. Or to change people (as in: my pastor really needs to talk to my neighbor)
<br><br>
But the teacher's job is to only to equip the saints. The good things we hope churches would do is done by the attendees of the church. And the change we want in ourselves, or others is done directly by God.

(verse about do not muzzle the ox)
It's ok to have paid professional pastors.
<br><br>
(verse about "not all should desire to be teachers".. more expectations from God)
It's a major act of service to lead, don't be quick to pick on or judge your pastor, but pray for your pastor and look for ways to build them up.

(verse about eating steak vs drinking milk)
Once during an outbreak, an illness that most people managed fine with sent some to the hospital with very serious and difficult to treat symptoms. As the outbreak continued for months, a hospital doctor out of his own curiosity made a habit to ask his patients "How many home cooked meals did you eat in the last two weeks?" The doctor was shocked at how commonly the sickest patients answered "none."

The same is true for our spirit as for our body. While "eating out" is a wonderful thing, if we neglect to do the work of feeding ourselves, then when the trying times come, our lack of healthy habits lead to predictable and severe symptoms.
