# Baptism
<Nav></Nav>

Before we get too deep, baptism is:
-One of only two rituals given to us by Jesus
-Something done once
-to (synonym of Proclaim) our new life

<br><br>
Baptize comes from a casual Greek word, in today’s English it could just as easily mean “immerse“
<br><br>
The verse could say “Go into all the world immersing people in the name of the father the son and the Holy Spirit“
