# My Own Jesus
<Nav></Nav>

Jesus is all powerful, all knowing, and saves us from Hell.
That is something that everyone seems to understand and can appreciate.
<br><br>
But you may hear people say things like "I think you're following a different Jesus" or "That's not the Jesus I know"
<br><br>
What's going on here is the result of differing, personal, definitions of Hell.
<br><br>
If your definition of Hell is a dirty ocean shoreline, you're going to imagine Jesus as the great environmentalist.
<br><br>
If your definition of Hell is powerful people being in power over other people. Then you're going to imagine Jesus as the great warrior overthrowing governments.
<br><br>
A wrong definition of Hell has serous outcomes. The article about Idols goes further into this.
<br><br>
The number definitions of the Hell that Jesus comes to rescue us from are vast. It's been this way for millennia. The last book of the Old Testament was written 600 years before Jesus came, and in that time many descriptions of the Messiah appeared. In the 1940's, the "Dead Sea Scrolls" were discovered which were some sort of Jewish book store's overstock from about 50 years before Jesus was born. In it include many church bible study resources from the time. The common theme was strong desire to know everything possible about the coming messiah. When people read Psalms back then for example, they were reading it for clues about the messiah.
<br><br>
Historians believe the "Wise Men" that came to see Jesus took time to prepare for their visit, including finding the right gift. To cover their bases, they brought a gift for each of the 3 prevailing expectations about Jesus. Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh, for a King, or a Priest, or a Profit respectively.
<br><br>
Much of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) unpacks the trouble that comes from the religious leaders that literally did not recognize Jesus standing right in front of them because he didn't fit what they wanted him to be. Lesson to learn: If your definition of God is such that Jesus can't fit in it, your definition of God is not ok.
<br><br>
Today we have the benefit of knowing the words of Jesus and he has revealed much to us. Jesus says "I am the way, nobody comes to the Father but through me". We cannot come to Jesus telling him who he needs to be. We can only come to Jesus on his terms.
<br><br>
So it is important to know, what is it that Jesus came to save us from? Only if we understand what Jesus saves us from will we have an unchanging solid admiration of Jesus.
<br><br>
Jesus came to fix our greatest problem.
We were all "stillborn" - born dead to the spirit of God. We all grew up separated from our loving creator.
We are all sons and daughters of Adam. Adam, who believed the lie that God was holding out on us, is a part of all of us. Adam chose the shiny apple to say "I don't need God. I can do better." That is our greatest problem.
<br><br>
Jesus restores individual relationships between God and you. Between God and I. Between God and anyone who will call out the lie that God is holding out on us, and move their eyes back to God to say "I don't need something else to do better."
<br><br>
Jesus saves us from the need to pay for all that we've done (mercy).
<br><br>
Jesus give us a new relationship status (grace).
<br><br>
That is the New Birth. Into the forever family of God.
<br><br>
If those are the things that make your heart shout "Yippie, Yahoo, Way to go God!" then your are worshiping the real Jesus that made himself known to us. You will be given strength and peace beyond understanding no matter what comes your way.
