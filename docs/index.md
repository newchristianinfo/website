## Purpose
<Verse reference="2nd Eric 1:2">bob</Verse>
God created you as a unique person - He planned your life before
your birth. God&nbsp;loves&nbsp;you!<br>
Even if you have felt alone and rejected,
God promises to always love you and be with you.

## Peace
Jesus promised to give you an inner peace no matter what is happening
in your life. "My peace I leave with you." Jesus' death paid your debt
to God in full - you are forgiven and you can begin your new life -
the awesome adventure of living in God's kingdom.

## Power
Jesus has given you a helper called the Holy Spirit, who now lives in you. The Holy Spirit gives you the power to change your life for the better and teaches you God's wisdom to handle life's challenges victoriously.

## Place
The kingdom of heaven is so unlike what we would imagine, how can someone understand it? God uses analogies to compare to things we know, often Jesus would say "The kingdom of heaven is like..." and when it comes to how God sees us, family is the consistent theme.

## Big Picture
Live long enough and look around, you'll come to the conclusion that "something has gone wrong". That things could have been better, but are messed up.
<br><br>
The Bible says this longing for greatness is written on our heart, it is intuitive to us. But because of Adam and Eve, there's something else intuitive to us that is more like a terminal heart problem. Also written in our heart is a lie that God is holding back on us, is keeping us from something better.
<br><br>
A theme you'll see in what it means to be a Christian is one root attitude - Either God's ways are boring, costly, burdensome and my ways are better. Or my ways are nothing compared to the exciting, perfect, rich, freedom found in following the one who created me and loves me.

## Family of God
This site is here to welcome you to the family. Check out our page on Adoption, and if you've chosen Jesus, print out our Certificate of New Birth.

This site is also here to smooth out the process of getting to know the Christian life and avoid some common "oh, I didn't know that" moments.
Are there rituals or ceremonies involved? What is the job of a pastor? Why do people in church have problems? How does God change my behavior?

## Book Reviews
In the movie Short Circuit, a robot comes to life and naturally has a thirst to learn "Input.. Input.." he'd say happily as he reads books and watches videos. It's not surprising that at some point in our new life, God will give us a joy of learning, and a desire to study.
