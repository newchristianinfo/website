# Societal Progress
<Nav></Nav>

Were things first in disorder/ignorance and are improving with each iteration? (Theory of evolution and SyFi Theology)<br>
-- Or --<br>
Were things made good and are collapsing? (Newton's second law of thermal dynamics, and the story arc in the Bible)
<br><br>
Those opposite assumptions become the root of a lot of opposite attitudes and choices among people.

"You can't stop progress" seems to be as certain as death and taxes. So let's zoom out for a moment to see what progress has done.
<br><br>
Most of our known history is spent going in circles with only a few elite families enjoying the luxuries we know today (and predictably falling into the same foolishness and pain because of it. (Read the signs next time you're on a castle tour). But since the industrial revolution, there's been a steady leveraging of business growth that have made new phases of life possible. Today allows all individuals to enjoy the convenience of kings, desire the same folly as lords, and suffer the same end.

This is best described by looking at how birthday parties are planned over the years. Notice how at each step, people become less capable and more critical of others if something goes wrong.
<br><br>
1) People originally were able to see the value in raw ingredients to make a cake themselves. If it turned out bad, the individual would need to learn and improve for next time.
2) Then they’d just buy a cake mix to make a cake. If it turned out bad, the individual would try a different mix next time.
3) Then they’d buy a pre-made cake all decorated with the kid’s name on it. If it turned out bad, the individual would do well to convincingly write a bad review.
4) Then they outsourced the whole party with a decorated room, entertainment, and cleanup all handled. If they didn't all leave happy, the system failed them.
5) The next and last step is the one we are living in.

That 4th phase which began about 1998 was all about “experiences” and purchase choices were based not on how it made me productive, but how it “made me feel”. We were attempting to outsource happy memories so we didn’t have to be responsible for that ourselves. Just like in a previous phase we lost the ability make a cake, we lost the ability to be happy on our own.
<br><br>
The next phase after consuming “experiences” is shopping for “perfection” where people get their identity, morality, and righteousness customized to fit them and easily delivered without any personal responsibility for those things. That is where progress crashes into a dead end, because only God is capable to give identity, morality, and righteousness. Outsourcing perfection is an impossible expectation, so it will end in buyer’s remorse and universally critical, complaining culture.
<br><br>
Progress, in the form of outsourcing, has brought people to a point where we don't know how to be happy. We lack the skills to calm down. And it is not worth the effort to understand our own heart and motivations since we are no longer personally responsible for a moral, functioning society. Any guilt felt inside a person is the fault of the system. Individuals are free to do previously unthinkable and horrific acts to anyone if they get in the way of my shopping for perfection.
<br><br>
Maybe it doesn’t get reversed. Maybe, like the man who builds his house on the shifting sands, there is a mighty crash (reference?). We’ve made a Titanic-scale effort at pretending there is no God, so of course it’s going to lead to something dramatic.
<br><br>
No matter how fast things change, some things stay the same. Progressives need Jesus. Conservatives need Jesus. The poor need Jesus. The rich need Jesus. Everyone needs Jesus to transform their own heart.
